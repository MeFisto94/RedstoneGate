# Redstone Gate Mod 
This repository is a work-in-progress (WIP), but this is the approach to port [The Redstone Gate / PAL v1.4.3beta](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1276201-1-2-3-the-redstone-gate-pal-v1-4-3-beta-block) to 1.10.2 and from Rizugami's ModLoader to Forge.

Note: I do not have the permission of the original author `Darquan`. He was not present on the minecraftforums since 2012.

In order to build this, you need the MCP/Forge MDK, which I did not include due to uncertain licensing issues.
The Project is configured to be used with intelliJ but I am certain that eclipse is also doable.
